Demon's Souls Any% SL1 is a speedrun category in which the player tries to complete the game as fast as possible while remaining at Soul Level 1 throughout the entire run. This category adds the challenge of completing the game without leveling up, requiring precise execution and strategic resource management.

## Subcategories

### Unrestricted
The standard Any% SL1 category with no restrictions on glitches, exploits, or sequence breaks. All known glitches and techniques are allowed, including PS Warps and Bow Tech.

### No Bow Tech
A variant of Any% SL1 that prohibits the use of bow-related glitches and techniques. This includes:
- Bow storage glitches
- Bow-related sequence breaks
- Any exploits involving the bow weapon
- PS Warps are also banned in this subcategory

## Rules

### General Rules
- **Force closing the game is banned**, except for IGT verification at the end of a run
- **Pre-order and deluxe items are banned**, as to not alienate later adopters or having a higher price of entry
- **Runs must be done offline**, going online by accident is fine as long as the runner goes back offline immediately
- **Save & Quit mechanic**: If used at any point during a run, you are required to resume gameplay immediately on the same character
- **Photo Mode is prohibited**, as it pauses your IGT
- **Players may not visually obstruct game elements** from the screen. All game elements that count towards the game's HUD need to be shown at all times during speedruns: [HUD Requirements](https://imgur.com/a/6BA3ZXR)
- **Runs submitted need to be seamless**, and actual Twitch highlights or YouTube videos not blocked needlessly because of music, as they are permanent

### Soul Level 1 Requirement
- **Any% SL1's starting class must be Royalty and also finish the game without ever leveling up with the Maiden in Black.**
- **You must remain at Soul Level 1 for the entire run**
- **No leveling up is allowed** - this includes using souls to increase any stats
- **If you accidentally level up**, the run is invalid and must be restarted
- **Starting class must be one that begins at Soul Level 1**

### PS Warps
**PS Warps are now BANNED for all categories except Unrestricted Any% and Unrestricted SL1.**

PS Warps are a feature that allows you to warp into the next level in a world you have already entered via the PS5 User Interface. As this suggests, these are not part of the actual game and tied to the PS5 UI. In 1.00 version, you cannot do these until you beat your first archdemon and receive the Nexial Agent.

### Bow Tech
**Bow Tech** is what we named the glitch that allows you to use a bow's aiming mechanic to have free movement at fog gates. This can be done at any fog gate and allows you to clip into many walls we couldn't before, and in some cases it allows us to freeze the AI of some bosses by going around their boss activation / cutscene trigger lines, or in some cases skip them all together.

- **Unrestricted categories** will allow this
- **No Bow Tech categories** will be separate and ban all aspects of the glitch

### Force Closing Exceptions
Force closing is allowed in these specific cases:
- **IGT verification at the end of a run**
- **Reset the game** if you are experiencing issues where the black screens and load games are getting excessively long, but it MUST be done once you are in the main menu of the game

### Performance Mode
You may change between performance and cinematic modes in main menu, however any delay in loading your character back in will cause a run to be denied, as you are intentionally keeping IGT from running without performing a game mechanic.

## Strategy Notes

This category requires exceptional skill and precision due to the Soul Level 1 restriction. Runners should:
- **Master parrying and dodging** as you cannot rely on high health or stamina
- **Optimize equipment choices** for maximum damage output at SL1
- **Learn boss patterns thoroughly** as mistakes are much more punishing
- **Use consumables strategically** to compensate for low stats
- **Practice difficult sections** extensively before attempting full runs

## IGT Verification Methods

### New Method (Recommended)
To end an Any% SL1 run, we have a new valid method to check the ingame time that should be faster than the previous. You are required to check at least Load Game Information IGT, and we strongly recommend you load the file back up to show the ending cutscene.

#### Capture Card Runners
For capture card runners, follow this method: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/ZMsbgdo-nTU)

#### PS5 Built-in Recording/Streaming
If you are using the built-in PS5 recording or streaming features for speedrunning, follow this video: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/QsB_5AylpC8)

### Outdated Methods (Fallback)
There are 3 outdated methods to check your ingame time for capture card users once a run is finished:

1. **After returning to the main menu** of Demon's Souls, go to Load Game -> Continue Online -> Options button on your speedrun character -> Information -> Total Time: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/KgJFwKLtkUY?t=35)

2. **Log on to a secondary character** that has access to the Nexus, and proceed to the Player Profiles Recent Profile segment of the Nexus: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/KgJFwKLtkUY?t=66)

3. **For PS+ accounts only**, log on to a secondary character that has beaten Phalanx, and go to the very top of the Nexus to reach the Pantheon: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/KgJFwKLtkUY?t=100)
