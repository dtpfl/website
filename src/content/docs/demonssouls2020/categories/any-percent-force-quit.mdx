# Any% Force Quit

## Introduction
Demon's Souls Any% Force Quit is a speedrun category in which the player tries to complete the game as fast as possible, utilizing force quit mechanics to skip certain areas or reset game states. This category allows strategic use of force quitting to optimize the run while maintaining the core speedrun challenge.

## Rules

### General Rules
- **Force closing the game is only allowed for wrong warps, and also for IGT verification at the end of a run. Abusing force quits to revert a death is still prohibited.**
- **Pre-order and deluxe items are banned**, as to not alienate later adopters or having a higher price of entry
- **Runs must be done offline**, going online by accident is fine as long as the runner goes back offline immediately
- **Save & Quit mechanic**: If used at any point during a run, you are required to resume gameplay immediately on the same character
- **Photo Mode is prohibited**, as it pauses your IGT
- **Players may not visually obstruct game elements** from the screen. All game elements that count towards the game's HUD need to be shown at all times during speedruns: [HUD Requirements](https://imgur.com/a/6BA3ZXR)
- **Runs submitted need to be seamless**, and actual Twitch highlights or YouTube videos not blocked needlessly because of music, as they are permanent

### PS Warps
**PS Warps are now BANNED for all categories except Unrestricted Any% and Unrestricted SL1.**

PS Warps are a feature that allows you to warp into the next level in a world you have already entered via the PS5 User Interface. As this suggests, these are not part of the actual game and tied to the PS5 UI. In 1.00 version, you cannot do these until you beat your first archdemon and receive the Nexial Agent.

**PS Warps should not be applicable for this category**, and thus we don't have a column for that, but if that changes we can easily add it.

### Force Quit Usage
**Unfortunately, you cannot submit a Force Quit run if you don't use a capture card, as force closing the game cuts off the PS5's built-in recording and streams. You also cannot perform the force quit warps in any version of the game besides 1.00 (unpatched disc version).**

Force quitting is allowed and encouraged in this category for:
- **Wrong warps** to skip certain areas
- **IGT verification at the end of a run**
- **Strategic resets** to optimize enemy positions or game states
- **Skipping certain areas** by resetting the game at specific points
- **Resetting boss encounters** to achieve optimal conditions
- **Optimizing item drops** or enemy behavior

### Performance Mode
You may change between performance and cinematic modes in main menu, however any delay in loading your character back in will cause a run to be denied, as you are intentionally keeping IGT from running without performing a game mechanic.

## IGT Verification Methods

### New Method (Recommended)
To end an Any% Force Quit run, we have a new valid method to check the ingame time that should be faster than the previous. You are required to check at least Load Game Information IGT, and we strongly recommend you load the file back up to show the ending cutscene / NG+, in case the hit of the Maiden isn't seen or heard too well, due to the menu covering the screen.

#### Capture Card Runners
For capture card runners, follow this method: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/ZMsbgdo-nTU)

#### PS5 Built-in Recording/Streaming
If you are using the built-in PS5 recording or streaming features for speedrunning, follow this video: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/QsB_5AylpC8)

### Outdated Methods (Fallback)
**There is only one of the old methods for checking ingame time in Force Quit:**

1. **After returning to the main menu** of Demon's Souls, go to Load Game -> Continue Offline -> Options button on your speedrun character -> Information -> Total Time: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/KgJFwKLtkUY?t=35)

## Strategy Notes

This category requires careful planning and execution of force quit strategies. Runners should:
- Practice force quit timing to minimize IGT loss
- Understand which areas benefit most from force quit resets
- Master the art of strategic game state manipulation
- Balance the benefits of force quitting against the time cost of reloading
- **Note: Capture card is required for this category**
