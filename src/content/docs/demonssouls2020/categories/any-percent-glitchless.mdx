import SpeedRunTable from '../../../../components/SpeedRunTable.astro';

Demon's Souls Any% Glitchless is a speedrun category in which the player tries to complete the game as fast as possible while avoiding specific glitches and exploits. This category allows some minor glitches and skips but prohibits major sequence breaks, wall clipping, out-of-bounds skips, and other major exploits.

## Rules

### General Rules
- **Force closing the game is banned**, except for IGT verification at the end of a run
- **Pre-order and deluxe items are banned**, as to not alienate later adopters or having a higher price of entry
- **Runs must be done offline**, going online by accident is fine as long as the runner goes back offline immediately
- **Save & Quit mechanic**: If used at any point during a run, you are required to resume gameplay immediately on the same character
- **Photo Mode is prohibited**, as it pauses your IGT
- **Players may not visually obstruct game elements** from the screen. All game elements that count towards the game's HUD need to be shown at all times during speedruns: [HUD Requirements](https://imgur.com/a/6BA3ZXR)
- **Runs submitted need to be seamless**, and actual Twitch highlights or YouTube videos not blocked needlessly because of music, as they are permanent

### PS Warps
**PS Warps are now BANNED for all categories except Unrestricted Any% and Unrestricted SL1.**

PS Warps are a feature that allows you to warp into the next level in a world you have already entered via the PS5 User Interface. As this suggests, these are not part of the actual game and tied to the PS5 UI. In 1.00 version, you cannot do these until you beat your first archdemon and receive the Nexial Agent.

### Force Closing Exceptions
Force closing is allowed in these specific cases:
- **IGT verification at the end of a run**
- **Reset the game** if you are experiencing issues where the black screens and load games are getting excessively long, but it MUST be done once you are in the main menu of the game

### Performance Mode
You may change between performance and cinematic modes in main menu, however any delay in loading your character back in will cause a run to be denied, as you are intentionally keeping IGT from running without performing a game mechanic.

## Important Notes

- **If a glitch is used but it's clear it's accidental and doesn't benefit the run**, we may allow the run to be verified. This will be at the discretion of the verifiers.
- **If glitches / skips are missing in the list**, contacting moderators is your priority. Doing these in runs will get your runs rejected.
- **The category is named Glitchless for a reason.**

## IGT Verification Methods

### New Method (Recommended)
To end an Any% glitchless run, we have a new valid method to check the ingame time that should be faster than the previous. You are required to check at least Load Game Information IGT, and we strongly recommend you load the file back up to show the ending cutscene.

#### Capture Card Runners
For capture card runners, follow this method: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/ZMsbgdo-nTU)

#### PS5 Built-in Recording/Streaming
If you are using the built-in PS5 recording or streaming features for speedrunning, follow this video: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/QsB_5AylpC8)

### Outdated Methods (Fallback)
There are 3 outdated methods to check your ingame time for capture card users once a run is finished:

1. **After returning to the main menu** of Demon's Souls, go to Load Game -> Continue Online -> Options button on your speedrun character -> Information -> Total Time: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/KgJFwKLtkUY?t=35)

2. **Log on to a secondary character** that has access to the Nexus, and proceed to the Player Profiles Recent Profile segment of the Nexus: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/KgJFwKLtkUY?t=66)

3. **For PS+ accounts only**, log on to a secondary character that has beaten Phalanx, and go to the very top of the Nexus to reach the Pantheon: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/KgJFwKLtkUY?t=100)
