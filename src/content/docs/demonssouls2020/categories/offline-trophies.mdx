# Offline Trophies

## Introduction
Demon's Souls Offline Trophies is a speedrun category in which the player tries to unlock all offline trophies as quickly as possible. This category focuses on completing various in-game achievements and challenges while maintaining the speedrun element. All trophies must be obtained without going online, ensuring accessibility for all players.

## Rules

### General Rules
- **Force closing the game is banned**, except for IGT verification at the end of a run, if needed, and we shall allow you to force close to reset the game if you are experiencing issues where the black screens and load games are getting excessively long, but it MUST be done once you are in the main menu of the game
- **Pre-order and deluxe items are banned**, as to not alienate later adopters or having a higher price of entry
- **Runs must be done offline**, going online by accident is fine as long as the runner goes back offline immediately
- **Save & Quit mechanic**: If used at any point during a run, you are required to resume gameplay immediately on the same character
- **Photo Mode is prohibited**, as it pauses your IGT
- **Players may not visually obstruct game elements** from the screen. All game elements that count towards the game's HUD need to be shown at all times during speedruns: [HUD Requirements](https://imgur.com/a/6BA3ZXR)
- **Runs submitted need to be seamless**, and actual Twitch highlights or YouTube videos not blocked needlessly because of music, as they are permanent

### Trophy Requirements
- **All offline trophies must be unlocked** during the run
- **Trophy unlocking must be visible** in the video submission
- **Trophy descriptions and requirements** must be clearly documented
- **No online-only trophies** are required for this category

### Account Requirements
**You are required to start a fresh account that will display all the trophies as you get them. As there is currently no way to reset Trophy progress in an account that already collected any, it is advised you use the Guest Quick Play PS5 account feature for resetting attempts. You may create dummy PSN accounts if you wish, but the usage of PS Warps will be banned for this category, due to the fact that we do not wish to encourage folks to create endless throwaway emails and PSN accounts just to grind this run.**

### Deluxe Items Restrictions
**During character creator, you are required to show that Deluxe Items Bundle are turned off or non-existant in the Starting Gift screen, as it gives an unfair advantage with the additional ring it provides without even needing to access the Thomas Storage. You are allowed to start with the Providential Ring gift, however.**

### PS5 Streaming Requirements
**If you are using the built-in PS5 streaming features for speedrunning, please watch this video to make sure that your broadcast will show the trophies properly, but as said in description, it will be your innitiative to make sure the trophies do indeed show in the stream: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/sAFHyeiG7Kk).**

### PS Warps
**PS Warps are now BANNED for all categories except Unrestricted Any% and Unrestricted SL1.**

PS Warps are a feature that allows you to warp into the next level in a world you have already entered via the PS5 User Interface. As this suggests, these are not part of the actual game and tied to the PS5 UI. In 1.00 version, you cannot do these until you beat your first archdemon and receive the Nexial Agent.

### Bow Tech
**Bow Tech** is what we named the glitch that allows you to use a bow's aiming mechanic to have free movement at fog gates. This can be done at any fog gate and allows you to clip into many walls we couldn't before, and in some cases it allows us to freeze the AI of some bosses by going around their boss activation / cutscene trigger lines, or in some cases skip them all together.

- **Unrestricted categories** will allow this
- **No Bow Tech categories** will be separate and ban all aspects of the glitch

### Force Closing Exceptions
Force closing is allowed in these specific cases:
- **IGT verification at the end of a run**
- **Reset the game** if you are experiencing issues where the black screens and load games are getting excessively long, but it MUST be done once you are in the main menu of the game

### Performance Mode
You may change between performance and cinematic modes in main menu, however any delay in loading your character back in will cause a run to be denied, as you are intentionally keeping IGT from running without performing a game mechanic.

## Strategy Notes

This category requires careful planning and execution to efficiently unlock all trophies. Runners should:
- **Plan trophy routes** to minimize backtracking and optimize time
- **Understand trophy requirements** thoroughly before attempting runs
- **Master multiple playstyles** to efficiently complete different challenges
- **Optimize character builds** for various trophy requirements
- **Practice difficult trophy sections** extensively before attempting full runs

## IGT Verification Methods

### New Method (Recommended)
**At the end of the run, quit out as soon as you think you've gotten the last trophy you need. If it turns out you didn't get it, you're allowed to go back in to the game to figure out what went wrong and fixing it even if you spent too much time in the main menu (within reason). You will be required to show the ingame time, and show that you are at 94%, or 34/37, progress of trophies, which disregards the 2 online trophies and the platinum. Hitting the PS Menu once to show the missing trophies isn't enough, as that menu isn't always up to date.**

To check ingame time, return to the main menu of Demon's Souls, go to Load Game -> Continue Offline -> Options button on your speedrun character -> Information -> Total Time: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/KgJFwKLtkUY?t=35). If you're in Current Patch, you may also log on to a secondary character, NOT the speedrun character, that has access to the Nexus, and proceed to the Player Profiles Recent Profile (far left profile) segment of the Nexus, before the Pantheon and Monumental: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/KgJFwKLtkUY?t=66)

#### Capture Card Runners
For capture card runners, follow this method: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/ZMsbgdo-nTU)

#### PS5 Built-in Recording/Streaming
**For direct PS5 streams checking the time at the end of the run, you may follow something along the lines of this video, which should be on par with capture card times as well: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/QsB_5AylpC8), simply ignore the ending bit. You will not be required to show the percentage or trophy count.**

### Outdated Methods (Fallback)
There are 3 outdated methods to check your ingame time for capture card users once a run is finished:

1. **After returning to the main menu** of Demon's Souls, go to Load Game -> Continue Online -> Options button on your speedrun character -> Information -> Total Time: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/KgJFwKLtkUY?t=35)

2. **Log on to a secondary character** that has access to the Nexus, and proceed to the Player Profiles Recent Profile segment of the Nexus: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/KgJFwKLtkUY?t=66)

3. **For PS+ accounts only**, log on to a secondary character that has beaten Phalanx, and go to the very top of the Nexus to reach the Pantheon: [Video Example](https://youtu.be/KgJFwKLtkUY?t=100)
