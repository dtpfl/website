<YouTube id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoHqbdffG7Q"/>

A glitch that duplicates consumable items in your hotbar.

### Requirements
- Bow with no arrows equipped
- At least 2 items in hotbar (glitch won't work with only 1 item)
- Item you want to duplicate in first hotbar slot

### How to Do It
1. **Fire Empty Bow**: Press R2 to fire the empty bow
2. **Queue Item Use**: Almost simultaneously, press Square 2-3 times to queue the item use
3. **Open Menu**: Open the menu and go to hotbar (press UP)
4. **Unequip Item**: Press Square to unequip the queued item
5. **Send to Storage**: Go to inventory (R1), select item (X), send to storage (X again)

### Tips
- You have roughly 2.2 seconds to complete all steps
- Practice with cheap items like healing grass first
- Organize inventory so the item is at top or bottom of the list

## Gold Coin Glitch - Luck Glitch <Badge text="v1.003 and below" variant="caution" />

A glitch that gives you maximum Luck (80,000+) and Soul Level 999. Gold Coins drop from Fat Officials in 2-2 (Tunnel City).

### Requirements
- 18 Strength, Dexterity, Magic, and Faith (to use Blueblood Sword)
- 1 Gold Coin (dropped by Fat Officials)

### How to Do It
1. **Farm Gold Coin**: Kill Fat Officials in 2-2 (Tunnel City) - Gold Coins are essentially guaranteed drops
2. **Level Up First**: Make sure you're completely leveled to where you want to be because you won't be able to level after this event
3. **Use Coin**: Approach the Maiden in Black and Crush the Gold Coin
4. **Open Menu**: Open the Soul Power Menu immediately after crushing the coin
5. **Watch Numbers Fly**: Your Luck and Soul Level will skyrocket to maximum values

### Warning
- Soul Level becomes 999 permanently
- Cannot level up further
- Use only after maxing other important stats

### Notes
- While most weapons work the same, a few with Luck Scaling become completely broken
- Gold Coins can stack for even more powerful effects
- This exploit was intentionally left in by Bluepoint as part of their "faithful" remake approach
- **Important**: You need the disc version with updates disabled or play in offline mode to use this glitch

## Wrong Warp Glitch <Badge text="v1.000" variant="caution" />

A glitch that allows you to warp to different archstones and skip entire levels by manipulating the PS5's memory of your last location.

<YouTube id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMDbqeziqxg"/>

### Requirements
- Version 1.0.0 (unpatched disc version)
- Auto-updates disabled and offline mode
- Save file where you've reached archstones OR reach an archstone within the same game

### How to Do It
1. **Set Memory**: Load into an archstone in your base game, then exit the game
2. **Start New Game**: Load a game where that archstone hasn't been reached
3. **Touch Main Archstone**: From Nexus, touch Boletarian Palace archstone
4. **Quick Exit**: Exit through PS5 menu "close app" right as you hear the "thud" of the fog loading screen
5. **Reload Game**: Reopen the game and continue with your loaded save
6. **Die**: Die from any cause (environmental or enemy damage)
7. **Respawn**: You'll respawn at the memorized archstone

### Key Points
- **Timing is crucial**: Close the app right as you hear the fog loading screen "thud"
- **Practice first**: Learn the timing before attempting serious runs
- **One chance per world**: The first wrong warp you do "locks" that archstone equivalent for that world
- **Nexial Binding**: After beating a main demon, you can wrong warp from any archstone

### Common Warp Paths
- **Lord's Path** → Armor Spider, Upper Latria, Leechmonger
- **Inner Ward** → Flamelurker, Ivory Tower, Ritual Path, Dirty Colossus  
- **King's Tower** → Dragon God, Old Monk, Old Hero, Maiden Astrea

### Warning
- **Use at your own risk** - this is a glitch
- **Version specific** - only works on v1.000
- **Capture card required** for speedrun submissions
- **Complex mechanics** - requires practice and understanding
