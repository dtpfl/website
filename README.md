## ðŸ“š Want to Make Changes to This Website?

**For beginners:** If you're reading this website and want to suggest changes, add new guides, or fix information, here's where to start:

- **`src/content/docs`** = This is where all the text and guides you see on the website are stored
- When you edit files here, you're updating the source code (not the live website yet)
- This is the main place you'll need to know about if you want to contribute changes

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `pnpm dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
